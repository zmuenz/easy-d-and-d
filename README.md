## Character Creation Made EZ

EZ RPG is a self-contained Role Playing Game character creation app. In this app, you can log-in or sign-up and create randomized (or self-picked) characters for any RPG (Examples could be Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder, among others). In this app, you are able to create and save your characters to be called later so you can always have a character ready between gaming sessions. With EZ RPG, character building has never been EZ-er! 

(we apologize for that terrible pun)

Login and Sign Up is done through modals. After logging in or signing up, you are then directed to the dashboard page for any characters being held from previous log-ins.

# Dashboard

The dashboard page is where characters that are previously created can be stored and called back to. This helps keep things convenient for the user as well as keeps continuity between gaming sessions.
